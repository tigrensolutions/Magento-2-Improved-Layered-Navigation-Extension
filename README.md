# Magento 2 Improved Layered Navigation Extension

It can be said that the product filter is one of the most common features for shoppers when visiting an e-commerce store, especially the large ones. In general, most Magento stores possess a huge number of products, ranging from 10,000 to 300,000. Therefore, if your store is not equipped with a good filtering tool (like Magento 2 Layered Navigation), it would definitely take a lot of time for your buyers to search for what they want. Many times, they feel tired and leave the store while what they are looking for might be just on the next page.

Because of that, the <b><a href="https://www.tigren.com/magento-2-extensions" rel="nofollow">Magento 2 Layered Navigation Extension</a></b> was developed to help the store owners to solve this issue effectively. To be more specific, it speeds up the filtering process to let the purchasers find their “wanted” products in just a few seconds. The buyers can freely choose from the style, color, and size of the products according to their favorites and select a price range that suits their budget. As a result, this Magento Layered Navigation extension might contribute to saving the customers’ shopping time, improving their experience, and probably buying more items in the store.

HOW IT WORKS</strong></span></p>

To apply the <b>Magento 2 Layered Navigation</b> feature on the front-end, firstly the customers must go to a specific <strong><em>Category</em> <em>page</em></strong>. After that, they can freely select as many product attributes as they want, such as <em>style, size, price, material,</em> and so on to do the filter. Then, the matching results will be displayed nearly immediately when each option is picked thanks to <em>Ajax loading</em>. At the same time, the searchers are also able to remove any chosen attributes to open the search scope. Finally, they might make a comparison among the remaining items or add these products to the cart.

OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF MAGENTO 2 LAYERED NAVIGATION</strong></span></h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px; color: #000080;"><strong>Fast Ajax Loading</strong></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">Luckily, with the help of <em><strong>Ajax</strong></em>, the searchers can combine various options and receive correlative results while staying on the current page.

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">There is a group of customers always concerning about buying from certain brands more than specific product characteristics. Due to that, the brand filter function is included in the <b>Magento 2 Layered Navigation Extension, </b>in order to give the buyers the fastest way to access the products of their favorite brands. </span>

![magento-2-layered-navigation-product-page-brand-1024x605](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26241389/162169748-30663c80-e857-4008-8689-be2894128315.png)

</ul>

All of the brand logos are arranged nicely on the All Brands page. When the visitors click on any of these logos, they will move to the Brand Details page. A tip to make your All Brands page look gorgeous is that you should select images that have the same size and similar colors.

All Products Page</strong></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">In contrast, by visiting the <strong><em>All Products page</em></strong>, the users need to select product attributes only one time for all of the items in the store.
